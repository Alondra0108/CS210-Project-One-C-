# CS210-Project-One-C-

This project, titled Chada Tech Clocks, was created as a final assignment for my CS 210 course. It is a C++ console-based application that simulates a dual-clock display system. After entering a starting time, the user is presented with two digital clocks: one in 12-hour format with AM/PM and one in 24-hour military time. The program allows the user to add one hour, one minute, or one second through a simple menu interface. The time updates accordingly, and the application continues running until the user selects the option to exit.

The structure of the program follows an object-oriented design using a custom Clock class. The class is defined in Clock.h and implemented in Clock.cpp, while main.cpp handles the user interaction and input validation. The Clock class contains private variables for hour, minute, and second, along with public methods to modify and retrieve these values. Additional helper functions manage formatting, such as adding leading zeros and converting the time into 12-hour or 24-hour string formats.

During development, I learned how to manage a C++ program that uses multiple files and how to separate declarations from definitions. I also gained experience working with classes, user input validation, and writing modular code. This project helped reinforce my understanding of time-based logic, conditionals, and how to build clean, reusable code. It was especially helpful in learning how to create and use helper functions for formatting output and controlling user interaction through a text-based menu.

This was one of my first full C++ programs, and it helped me understand the structure and flow of object-oriented applications. It also taught me the importance of keeping code organized across header and implementation files. Overall, the Chada Tech Clocks project was an important milestone in my development as a programmer, and it gave me the confidence to build more advanced applications using the C++ language.
